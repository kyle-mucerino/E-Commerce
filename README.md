# E-Commerce
We wanted to build the back end for an e-comerce site. We created a database that included models of Category, Product, Tag, and Product Tag. We use express.js API and Sequelize to interact a My SQL database. We wanted to make it so you can add a Category, Product, or Tag. Also are the abilites to delete, or update.
